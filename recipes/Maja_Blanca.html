        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can (13.5 fl oz) coconut milk </li>
                <li>1 ½ cup evaporated milk or fresh milk</li>
                <li>1 cup sweetened condensed milk </li>
                <li>¾ cup cornstarch - dissolved in ¾ cup milk </li>
                <li>½ cup corn kernel - drained </li>
                <li>½ cup desiccated coconut </li>
                <li>butter or margarine - for greasing pan</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol type="i" >
                <li>Grease a (21x21cm) square pan with butter or margarine. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Combine coconut milk, milk and condensed milk in a pot and bring to boil over medium heat while stirring occasionally.</li>
                <li>Add the corn kernel. Pour in the cornstarch mixture and stir constantly and quickly until the texture turns into a paste-like consistency. Remove from heat and transfer to greased pan immediately. Gently tap the pan on the kitchen counter a couple of times to get rid of trapped bubbles and even out the surface with spatula or spoon. Let the Maja Blanca settle and cool down.</li>
                <li>Toast the coconut flakes in a pan over low fire until browned. Stir constantly to avoid burning them. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle top with toasted coconut flakes.</li>
